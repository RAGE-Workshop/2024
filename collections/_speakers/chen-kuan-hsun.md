He obtained his Ph.D. degree (May 2019) in Computer Science (Dr.-Ing.) from TU Dortmund University with the highest distinction (summa cum laude), under the supervision of Prof. Jian-Jia Chen. He completed his master's degree in Computer Science (2013) and his bachelor's degree in the Interdisciplinary Program of Humanities and Social Sciences (2011) at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan.
    He currently serves as Guest Editor for the ACM Transactions of Cyber-Physical Systems and the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems. Furthermore, he has published 60+ scientific works in top peer-reviewed journals (e.g., TC and TECS) and international conferences (e.g., EMSOFT, RTSS, RTAS, DAC, ECML, DATE). Additionally, he actively participates as a member of several Technical Program Committees (TPC) for premier conferences and contributes as a reviewer for various peer-reviewed journals and conferences in the field of computer science and engineering.
    He is one founder of the Dutch Real-Time System Community, funded by 4TU.NIRICT. Furthermore, he is also responsible for the course "Design and Implementation of Real-Time Systems", granted by the ASCI research school. His achievements include Best Paper Award at ECRTSâ€™23, Best Paper nomination at DATE'21, Best Student Paper Award at RTCSA'18, and a dissertation award at TU Dortmund University (2019).
