    "Alessandro Biondi is Associate Professor of Computer Engineering at the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna of Pisa (Italy), where he works at the Real-Time Systems (ReTiS) Laboratory.
    His main research interests include the design and implementation of real-time, safe, and secure cyber-physical systems, operating systems and hypervisors, synchronization protocols, design optimization for embedded systems, and formal analysis of scheduling algorithms.
    He graduated cum laude in Computer Engineering at the University of Pisa, Italy, within the excellence program. In 2017, he received a PhD cum laude in Emerging Digital Technologies (curriculum Embedded Systems) at the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna under the supervision of Prof. Giorgio Buttazzo and Prof. Marco Di Natale.
    In 2016, he has been Visiting Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Kaiserslautern (Germany), where he worked with Prof. Bjoern B. Brandenburg.
    He was the recipient of several awards including six Best Paper Awards, one Best Journal Paper Award (IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics), one Outstanding Paper Award, one Best Presentation Award, one Best Paper Nomination, the EDAA Outstanding Dissertation Award 2017 in the area "New directions in software design and optimization for embedded, cyber-physical and secure systems", and the ACM SIGBED Early Career Award 2019.
    Alessandro Biondi has been involved as member of the Program Committee of top conferences in the area of real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems. He is Associate Editor of Journal of Real-Time Systems (Springer), the major journal on time-critical computing, and he served as reviewer for most IEEE/ACM Transactions journals that cover research on embedded and cyber-physical systems. He served as TPC Vice-Chair of EMSOFT 2023, TPC Chair of EMSOFT 2024, and TPC Track Co-Chair of ETFA 2023 and 2022.
    He published several papers in international conferences, quality journals, and workshops, and filed two patents. He is currently leading industrial research projects in the area of safety-critical and secure software systems for automotive and railway industries, and he has been involved in research projects funded by the European Commission.
    Alessandro Biondi is also co-founder of two spin-off companies: Accelerat, focused on software solutions for safe, secure, and predictable cyber-physical systems, and Wriggle Solutions (IP now acquired), focused on real-time tyre monitoring systems. Wriggle Solutions received seven awards for startup companies at both the national and international level, and the SME Instrument grant from the European Commission."
